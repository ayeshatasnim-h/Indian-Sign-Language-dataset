There are 26 classes and 486 processed and augmented images per class and these images can undergo further augmentation to boost the size and increase the images per class.
Further classes can also be added (i.e numbers, words, etc.) to increase the research scope.

Also added is the train and test csv files of the dataset split into 20-80 as of December 6, 2020. These csv files have been shuffled and labeled with each row representing the pixel values of each image.
These have been successfully used for Image Recognition project using Neural Networks with great accuracy metrics.
